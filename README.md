# Dot density scripts
A set of Node scripts for generating evenly spread dots that will drop nicely at each zoom level when converted to vector tiles with Tippecanoe.

Input and output files are in a GeoJSON-LD (line-delimited) format, which allows for line-by-line processing of files, massively reducing the RAM required to run this kind of operation.

## make-dots.js
Script for generating raw dots given a set of GeoJSON boundaries and per-boundary population counts.

The order of the generated dots allows them to be dropped sequentially while maintaining an even spread of dots within a given boundary.

## make-datasets.js
Script for applying datasets to the dots generated with the above script. Input datasets should be defined in /config/datasets.js and data files should be added to the /input/ folder.

The generated dots include a "minzoom" property that tells Tippecanoe a what zoom level to drop them.

## make-pmtiles.sh
A set of Tippecanoe commands for generating .pmtiles vector tiles from the dots generated by the above scripts.

## make-quads.js
A related script.
